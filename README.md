Advent of Code 2023 solutions, by Yours Truly, in C++.

The main goal of AoC2023 for me is to learn C++, properly. Not just "C++-flavoured C", or rather "C with `std::cout` and `std::string`", but proper, generic C++, with healthy portions of STL baked in.

The side objective is to get better at algorithmic thinking, naturally.

 Whatever. MIT.
